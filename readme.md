🔮 Obsidian is a comprehensive Swift 6+ utility library that transforms error handling, optional chaining, and reactive messaging. It replaces Swift's symbolic operations (`??`, `map`, `flatMap`) with natural language methods (`otherwise`, `transform`, `when`) while providing a complete actor-safe messaging framework for building event-driven applications.

## Modules

Obsidian is organized into focused modules, each addressing specific aspects of Swift development:

### [**ObsidianCore**](Sources/Core/readme.md)
Natural language extensions for Optional and Result types with seamless conversion between them. Transform how you work with Swift's fundamental types using expressive, readable methods like `otherwise`, `transform`, `when`, and `transmute`.

### [**ObsidianFoundation**](Sources/Foundation/readme.md)
Protocols for consistent interfaces across types: `Uniquable` for UUID-based identification, `Namable` for consistent naming, `Describable` for textual descriptions, and `Representable` for combined representation.

### [**ObsidianFlow**](Sources/Flow/readme.md)
A comprehensive reactive messaging framework providing type-safe messaging primitives with Pulses, Channels, and Streams. Built for Swift's actor system with natural language APIs and immutable message design.

### **Obsidian** (Umbrella Module)
The main module that imports and exposes Core, Foundation, and Flow modules. Import `Obsidian` to access all Obsidian features: utilities, protocols, and reactive messaging.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Add Obsidian to your Swift package dependencies:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/beeauvin/obsidian.git", upToNextMinor: "0.3.0")
]
```

### Basic Usage

Import Obsidian to access all features:

```swift
import Obsidian  // Imports Foundation utilities and Flow framework
```

For Flow-specific functionality, you can also import individual modules:

```swift
import ObsidianFlow  // Just the reactive messaging framework
import ObsidianCore  // Just the utility extensions
```

## Quick Start

```swift
import Obsidian

// Use natural language Optional extensions
let username: String? = get_username()
let display_name = username.otherwise("Guest")

// Chain Result operations for robust error handling
let user_data = await Result<Data, Error>.Catching {
    try await api.fetch_user_data()
}.transform { data in
    try JSONDecoder().decode(User.self, from: data)
}.otherwise { DefaultUser() }

// Create reactive message flows
struct UserAction: Pulsable {
    let action: String
    let timestamp: Date
}

let action_channel = Channel { pulse in
    await process_user_action(pulse.data)
}

let action_pulse = Pulse(UserAction(action: "login", timestamp: Date()))
    .priority(.high)
    .tagged("user", "auth")

await action_channel.send(action_pulse)
```
